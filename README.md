# Set up the dev enviroment

This projects consists of the following two components: 
- A wordpress site as the content management system
- A frontity project that lets us configure the website with React

First please make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

To run the wordpress site locally we used a tool called [Local](https://localwp.com/). Just install the program and drag the zip-file called `toolkit-wordpress` into it like it's shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7Wb1p1GV7E. If you'll make changes to the wordpress project, you'll have to create a new zip containing: 
- the .sql file you'll find in the folder `dub-installer`
- the folder `wp-content`

Once the wordpress instance is running, you may need to make some changes that are explained in the file `AnhangWordpress.pdf`
